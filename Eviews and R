#simple way to load an read wf1 files from EViews in R
# it doesnt skip boilerplot variables
library(EviewsR)
file <- readEViews("file directory", as.data.frame = F)
# data will be loaded as a list, then you can apply required modifications in order to be able to build a data frame afterwards...
 # e.g. eliminating list number 1 and 6 from travel list:
travel <- travel[-c(1,6)]
 # I did so for being able to build up a data frame with a list containing same number of rows in each column...

file <- data.frame(list)

# all set to work :)
